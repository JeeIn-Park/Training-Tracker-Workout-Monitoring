good to ask supervisor (if you can achieve it...)
15 week project - what you can do in certain amount of time
(can be possible future work...) think it as 12 weeks, 8 weeks you can actually work on your project

you can completely change the topic working on it

You can have a supervisor outside of cs, but still need to have cs supervisor

don't take something will take ages to be finished (so you can finish it at the end of the tb2, and complete the project)

until week 8, you can select the project
