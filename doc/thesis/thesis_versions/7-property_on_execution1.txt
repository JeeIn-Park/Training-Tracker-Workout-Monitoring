\chapter*{Abstract}

{\bf A compulsory section, of at most 300 words} 
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
and main contributions (e.g., deliverables) and achievements; the same 
section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the 
reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this 
topic, {\em and} what your view of the outcome is.

The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
chapter. If your project is experimental in nature, this should include 
a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
for each project, but an example might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
My research hypothesis is that a suitable genetic algorithm will yield
more accurate results (when applied to the standard ACME data set) than 
the algorithm proposed by Jones and Smith, while also executing in less
time.
\end{quote}

\noindent
The latter aspects should (ideally) be presented as a concise, factual 
bullet point list.  Again the points will differ for each project, but 
an might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the 
      Java garbage-collection sub-system. 
\item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux 
      device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is 
      used to control it.
\item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping 
      from A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
\item I implemented a version of the algorithm proposed by Jones and 
      Smith in [6], see page $12$, corrected a mistake in it, and 
      compared the results with several alternatives.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


\chapter*{Dedication and Acknowledgements}

{\bf A compulsory section}
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
It is common practice (although totally optional) to acknowledge any
third-party advice, contribution or influence you have found useful
during your work.  Examples include support from friends or family, 
the input of your Supervisor and/or Advisor, external organisations 
or persons who  have supplied resources of some kind (e.g., funding, 
advice or time), and so on.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures and tables.  These are all compulsory parts of the dissertation.

\chapter*{Ethics Statement}


An ethics application for this project was reviewed and approved by the faculty research ethics committee as application 18166


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Supporting Technologies}

{\bf An optional section}
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
This section should present a detailed summary, in bullet point form, 
of any third-party resources (e.g., hardware and software components) 
used during the project.  Use of such resources is always perfectly 
acceptable: the goal of this section is simply to be clear about how
and where they are used, so that a clear assessment of your work can
result.  The content can focus on the project topic itself (rather,
for example, than including ``I used \mbox{\LaTeX} to prepare my 
dissertation''); an example is as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item I used the Java {\tt BigInteger} class to support my implementation 
      of RSA.
\item I used a parts of the OpenCV computer vision library to capture 
      images from a camera, and for various standard operations (e.g., 
      threshold, edge detection).
\item I used an FPGA device supplied by the Department, and altered it 
      to support an open-source UART core obtained from 
      \url{http://opencores.org/}.
\item The web-interface component of my system was implemented by 
      extending the open-source WordPress software available from
      \url{http://wordpress.org/}.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Notation and Acronyms}

{\bf An optional section}
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
Any well written document will introduce notation and acronyms before
their use, {\em even if} they are standard in some way: this ensures 
any reader can understand the resulting self-contained content.  

Said introduction can exist within the dissertation itself, wherever 
that is appropriate.  For an acronym, this is typically achieved at 
the first point of use via ``Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)'' or 
similar, noting the capitalisation of relevant letters.  However, it 
can be useful to include an additional, dedicated list at the start 
of the dissertation; the advantage of doing so is that you cannot 
mistakenly use an acronym before defining it.  A limited example is 
as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
AES                 &:     & Advanced Encryption Standard                                         \\
DES                 &:     & Data Encryption Standard                                             \\
                    &\vdots&                                                                      \\
${\mathcal H}( x )$ &:     & the Hamming weight of $x$                                            \\
${\mathbb  F}_q$    &:     & a finite field with $q$ elements                                     \\
$x_i$               &:     & the $i$-th bit of some binary sequence $x$, st. $x_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}


% =============================================================================

% After the front matter comes a number of chapters; under each chapter,
% sections, subsections and even subsubsections are permissible.  The
% pages in this part are numbered with Arabic numerals.  Note that:
%
% - A reference point can be marked using \label{XXX}, and then later
%   referred to via \ref{XXX}; for example Chapter\ref{chap:context}.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:context}

\noindent
In recent years there has been a surge in public awareness of the important role physical activity plays in maintaining health, which is reflected in the frequency of gym visits. From 2010 to 2019, there had been a 24\% increase in the number of individuals attending the gym over 100 times annually.

As fitness demands increase, the importance of monitoring workout progress becomes more apparent because the availability of quantifiable data can stimulate users' interest in enhancing their activity levels. This implies that providing tools to track this data supports the maintenance of motivation and commitment to fitness goals, which could lead to improved health outcomes over time.

The growth in recognition of training and tracking progression has led to significant expansion in the global fitness app market, as these apps allow users to monitor their workouts anytime and anywhere. In 2023, the market was valued at \$1.54 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7\% from 2024 to 2030. This trend is underscored by a marked rise in the number of fitness app users and downloads, with hundreds of millions of users and over 850 million downloads reported in 2023 alone. 

The market expansion has led to numerous workout tracking apps that primarily focus on quantitative data. However, features limited to logging and analysing progress are inadequate for sustaining user adherence to physical activity goals. Identifying and integrating motivational factors into app design is crucial for enhancing user engagement and promoting consistent exercise routines.

\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:technical}

\section{About Muscle Visualisation}
... % TODO : benefits of muscle visualisation 
% TODO : comparing to existing apps

\section{Muscle Physiology and Its Relevance to Fitness Tracking Technology}

In the context of this software development project, understanding muscle dynamics is not merely an academic exercise but a practical necessity for creating an app that transcends simple activity tracking. A comprehensive grasp of muscle physiology is crucial for developing fitness applications that do more than merely monitor user activity—they also significantly enhance user engagement and the effectiveness of their training routines. By incorporating scientifically grounded recommendations for workout frequency, intensity, recovery, and strength benchmarks, the app can be crafted to offer users a tailored fitness experience that optimises their progression and adheres to safe training practices.

The physiological insights discussed here will provide the scientific foundation essential to guiding the app's development, ensuring that all features are designed to effectively support the user's fitness journey. This background not only positions the app as a robust tracking tool but also as an educational resource that promotes physical well-being and informed training choices, distinguishing it from less comprehensive solutions currently on the market.


\subsection{Muscle Growth}

Muscle hypertrophy, or growth, is primarily driven by consistent and strategically varied resistance training. Key factors influencing hypertrophy include the frequency of workouts, intensity and volume of exercises, and crucially, adequate recovery times between sessions. Scientifically, muscles require regeneration periods after being stressed, which involves both the repair of muscle fibers and their growth in strength and size. This biological process is the basis for recommending that each muscle group be trained approximately two to three times per week \cite{Schoenfeld2016}. Integrating this knowledge into a fitness app ensures users receive scientifically-backed guidance on how to structure their workouts for maximum efficacy.


\subsection{Muscle Loss}

Conversely, muscle atrophy occurs when there is a prolonged lack of muscle use, and understanding this is just as vital. The rate at which muscles atrophy can begin is startling—noticeable decreases in muscle mass and strength can occur within just a few weeks of inactivity. This understanding is essential for developing app features that motivate users to maintain regular exercise routines. For example, the app can remind users to engage muscle groups that have not been recently active, thereby utilising physiological data to help prevent atrophy and promote healthier, more active lifestyles.


\subsection{One-Rep Max (1RM)}

Furthermore, the one-rep max (1RM) is a critical metric in strength training, representing the maximum weight an individual can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise. It is a valuable index for setting benchmarks and measuring strength gains over time. Incorporating 1RM calculations into the app provides users with a quantitative tool to set realistic goals and track their progress in strength training, enhancing both motivation and the personalisation of training programs.

A solid grasp of these aspects not only shapes the initial design but also influences the entire development lifecycle, from integrating new features to adapting based on user feedback and technological advancements.

In the realm of app development, recognising and prioritising these core properties streamlines the process and enhances efficiency. The ability of these properties to adapt dynamically in response to evolving user needs is crucial. It aligns the application with user expectations, increases user engagement, and positions the application for success in a competitive market \cite{Hallsteinsen2008}. By clearly defining these fundamental aspects, developers can prevent feature creep—the inclusion of unnecessary features that do not serve the app's primary purpose. This focused approach maintains essential functionality, optimises resource allocation, and improves the user experience by making the app more intuitive and easier to navigate \cite{Lieberman2006}.

This understanding is particularly critical in the context of fitness tracking apps, where the sensitivity of personal data and its direct impact on users' health heighten the importance of these considerations. Fitness apps provide robust tools for logging and managing exercise details such as type, duration, intensity, and frequency. This systematic logging helps users track their progress and adjust their fitness routines to better achieve their goals. Features that provide visual representations of progress and historical performance data not only support goal-setting but also motivate users by clearly demonstrating their advancements.
The deliberate selection of motivation, consistency, accessibility, accuracy, and privacy as key properties significantly enhances the effectiveness and user satisfaction of fitness tracking apps. Each attribute plays a strategic role:

\subsubsection{Motivation}
Motivation is essential for engaging users and encouraging regular app usage, critical for achieving fitness goals. Features that foster motivation include goal-setting, progress tracking, and gamification elements such as badges and leaderboards. These elements not only help users set and meet personal fitness goals but also create a sense of community and competition, substantially increasing the likelihood of app retention and routine adherence.

\subsubsection{Consistency}
Consistency ensures the app remains a reliable tool throughout the user's fitness journey. This reliability comes from stable performance, regular feature updates, and a consistent user interface, crucial for habit formation. Users are more likely to continue using an app that provides a predictable and smooth experience without frequent crashes or bugs, fostering trust and a routine usage pattern.

\subsubsection{Accessibility}
 Accessibility enhances the app's ease of integration into daily routines and its overall user-friendliness. Convenience in a fitness app encompasses several aspects that minimise effort and maximise efficiency for the user. Moreover, convenience involves ensuring that the app does not require excessive setup or maintenance from the user. Features like automatic tracking of activities, straightforward input methods for food and exercise logs, and easy-to-navigate menus contribute to an app’s convenience. The goal is to reduce barriers to entry and continued use, thereby integrating smoothly into daily routines without causing disruption. Simplicity relates closely to the design and usability of the app. A simple, clean interface with intuitive navigation and minimalistic design helps users understand how to use the app quickly without needing extensive tutorials or help pages. Simplifying the interaction design—such as reducing the number of taps required to enter or retrieve information—enhances user satisfaction and decreases frustration. Simplicity also means focusing on core functionalities and avoiding unnecessary features that can clutter the app and confuse the user. By concentrating on the essentials, developers can provide a streamlined experience that prioritises ease of use over complexity.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}
 Accuracy of the data collected by the app builds trust and utility. Precise tracking of steps, calories burned, and other fitness metrics allows users to monitor their progress accurately and make informed decisions about their health routines. Trust in the app’s data accuracy is critical, as it not only impacts user confidence in the app but also influences their long-term fitness strategies and outcomes.

\subsubsection{Privacy}
Privacy is paramount, especially given the sensitivity of the data handled by fitness apps. Protecting this data through strong encryption, compliance with data privacy laws, and clear user data controls reassures users about the security of their personal information. Transparency in data management builds further trust, ensuring users feel safe sharing their health data with the app.

\subsection{Feature Analysis and Alignment with Core Properties in Fitness App Development}

Aligning features with user needs not only enhances engagement and retention but also allows for the tailoring of offerings to individual preferences, thereby broadening market appeal and increasing user satisfaction. Features like goal setting and progress tracking not only motivate users by supporting regular exercise and healthy habits but also ensure that the app stands out in a competitive market through unique functionalities. Prioritising essential features through effective resource management optimises development efforts and ensures scalability, facilitating future growth without the need for extensive modifications. Additionally, features must incorporate robust security measures to protect user data and comply with privacy laws, ensuring user trust and regulatory adherence. The integration of these features into the app's architecture and user interface requires meticulous planning, from technical performance to aesthetic design, to enhance the overall user experience and functionality. This strategic approach to feature integration and testing assures that the app operates seamlessly, meeting the high standards required for successful market introduction and user adoption.


\subsubsection{Workout Analysis} 

Workout Analysis Features comprise a comprehensive set of tools for tracking and evaluating athletic performance over time. Utilising various metrics, these tools chart an individual's progress, offering insights into their physical strengths and areas for enhancement. The continuous display of trends and performance improvements is crucial for the regular assessment of a user’s fitness journey.

A key benefit of Workout Analysis Features is their ability to demonstrate quantifiable progress towards fitness goals, thereby boosting user motivation and consistency. Observing concrete progress and receiving performance feedback encourages users to persist and surpass their objectives, significantly aiding in sustained user engagement by continuously highlighting their accomplishments and necessary steps for ongoing improvement. These tools enable precise adjustments to workout plans based on solid data, facilitating more efficient training and better physical results. Additionally, the automation of data processing through smartphones—from gathering to calculating data—reduces errors common in manual entries, increasing data reliability and saving time. This automation simplifies the documentation and analysis of workout information, presenting it in easily understandable formats like graphs and charts, which help users easily visualise and comprehend their fitness progress over time.

Nevertheless, deploying Workout Analysis Features raises concerns, especially regarding privacy and data security. Storing and processing personal workout data, which may include sensitive health information, introduces potential risks. Users must be confident in the security of their data and the preservation of their privacy, which is not always assured. The possibility of a data breach could result in unauthorised access to personal information, emphasising the importance of robust security protocols and clear data management policies in fitness apps. 

    
\subsubsection{Goal Setting}

Goal Setting Features help users define and track fitness goals that align with their health ambitions. These features facilitate the establishment of specific, measurable objectives across various areas. Users input precise targets into these tools to monitor their advancement and remain focused on reaching their fitness milestones.

Creating explicit fitness goals is vital within any workout regimen, acting as a motivator and encouraging consistent exercise. Setting clear targets provides a structured guide for daily activities, increasing commitment to the exercise plan. This methodical setup sustains high motivation by offering achievable milestones, which enhance users' sense of achievement as they see their own progress. The goals' visibility in the app consistently reminds users of their aims, promoting ongoing interaction with the fitness program and increasing the chances of long-term app engagement.

However, there are drawbacks to setting goals, especially when the targets are unrealistic. Goals that do not account for an individual’s physical limitations or realistic circumstances can cause feelings of failure and dissatisfaction, potentially reducing motivation and negatively affecting overall fitness engagement. Additionally, the requirement to enter and store personal health data for goal tracking raises privacy issues. The robustness of the app's security measures to safeguard sensitive information is essential; inadequate security can lead to data breaches, decreasing user trust and posing risks to personal information.

    
\subsubsection{Exercise Personalising}

Exercise personalisation is a feature that improves the flexibility of fitness apps by enabling users to incorporate custom exercises into their routines, catering to everyone from mainstream fitness enthusiasts to those engaged in niche or highly specific activities.

This feature allows for the customisation by adding preferred or specialised exercises, meeting the varied needs and interests of users and significantly boosting their engagement and satisfaction with the app. It is especially useful for individuals involved in specialised sports or activities requiring unique movements not typically found in standard exercise databases. Personalisation not only keeps exercises diverse and interesting but also allows users to adapt their fitness plans for specific objectives, such as injury rehabilitation or focused muscle development. By supporting the integration of tailored exercises, these apps appeal to a wide array of fitness enthusiasts. The ability to add unique exercises that meet individual preferences and needs enhances the app’s usefulness and relevance, thus encouraging longer-term commitment and consistent exercise routines. Additionally, this feature increases the accessibility and inclusiveness of fitness apps, potentially attracting a larger audience with various physical abilities and training objectives.

However, exercise personalisation introduces several challenges. Users with limited knowledge of exercise fundamentals might add inappropriate or unsafe exercises to their routines, increasing the risk of injuries. Additionally, personalising exercises can complicate the app’s capacity to track and analyse performance effectively. While most fitness apps use algorithms designed to monitor progress with predefined exercises, these may not perform as well with customised activities. This can lead to less accurate tracking and feedback for non-standard exercises, potentially reducing the app's effectiveness in monitoring progress and offering valuable insights.


\subsubsection{Routine Personalising} 

Routine personalisation in fitness applications allows users to design and adjust their own workout routines and categories, tailoring exercises to suit their unique needs and preferences. This feature enables the development of tailored workout sessions by amalgamating various exercises to match individual fitness objectives or training preferences. Users can select exercises from a vast database and categorise them into different groups such as cardio, strength, flexibility, and balance. This categorisation is further refined by parameters such as the equipment required, the intensity level, and the specific muscle groups targeted, allowing users to customise their workouts to achieve distinct goals like weight loss, strength enhancement, or improved flexibility. This high degree of personalisation not only aids in organising workouts more efficiently but also ensures that the routines are comprehensive and cater to personal fitness goals, covering a broad spectrum of physical activities.

The ability to create personalised workout routines offers significant benefits as it accommodates a diverse range of users, from beginners to advanced athletes, and from yoga aficionados to weightlifting enthusiasts. This flexibility allows individuals to craft exercise plans that resonate with their personal fitness levels, objectives, and schedules. Users' active involvement in designing these routines fosters a deeper commitment to their fitness journey, increasing engagement and satisfaction. Structured plans are crucial as they help prevent neglecting certain types of exercises or muscle groups, thereby promoting a balanced training regime. Moreover, systematically categorised and pre-planned routines streamline progress tracking, facilitate the recognition of patterns, and aid in making adjustments to meet fitness goals effectively. This organisation enhances the app's utility, making it easier for users to start exercising promptly, thus improving efficiency and user experience. By personalising their workout schedules, users gain a sense of ownership and control, which significantly boosts their motivation and enjoyment, ensuring that the regimen remains comprehensive and well-coordinated.

However, while the customisation of workout routines brings numerous advantages, it also poses certain challenges. Properly utilising this feature requires a solid understanding of exercise design principles to avoid creating unbalanced or ineffective workouts. For inexperienced users, there is a risk of developing routines that are either too demanding or insufficiently challenging, which can lead to injuries or lack of motivation. Additionally, personalising workouts complicates the app’s capacity to track and analyse performance accurately. Fitness apps are generally equipped with algorithms that are fine-tuned for standard workouts, and these may not adapt well to customised, user-defined categories, potentially leading to imprecise feedback and suboptimal tracking of progress. This could detract from the app’s effectiveness in aiding users to meet their fitness goals. 

    
\subsubsection{Fitness Calendar} 
Planning features in fitness applications, particularly the use of a workout planning calendar, are invaluable for helping users schedule individual workouts and manage their training phases. By allowing for the integration of fitness activities with other life commitments through a visual calendar, users can foster better habit formation, maintain regular exercise, and achieve a harmonious balance between fitness and other responsibilities.

The benefits of utilising a planning tool in fitness apps are significant. Effective planning facilitates the correct pacing of workouts, helping to prevent overtraining and injuries by ensuring adequate rest and recovery times. This structured approach not only enhances time management, allowing users to integrate their fitness routines seamlessly into their daily lives, but also supports the balancing of these commitments with personal and professional obligations. Effective planning aids in adhering to a consistent exercise routine by visually organising fitness activities around other commitments, leading to more realistic and sustainable workout plans and promoting better habit formation and balanced training.

However, integrating complex planning features into fitness apps can also present challenges. Over-planning may induce rigidity in exercise routines, making it difficult for users to adapt to unexpected changes in their schedule or physical condition, potentially leading to missed workouts or burnout. Additionally, while a comprehensive workout calendar can help integrate various activities, it may also complicate the app's interface, deterring users who prefer simpler interfaces. The presence of numerous features can overwhelm users, cluttering the app and creating confusion. Moreover, fitness apps are generally not designed to manage broader life scheduling needs, potentially reducing their effectiveness in meeting specific fitness planning requirements. Privacy concerns are another significant issue, as the storage of sensitive scheduling information necessitates robust security measures to protect user data. 

    
 \subsubsection{Reminders} 
 
Reminder features in fitness apps, such as workout notifications, are delivered through push notifications or alerts to inform users of upcoming workouts, integrating fitness more seamlessly into their daily routines. This feature ensures that workouts are not overlooked amidst the busy lives of users, enhancing the likelihood of achieving their fitness goals.

These reminders provide users with timely notifications, helping to maintain a regular workout schedule, which is essential for building and sustaining exercise habits. It facilitates better adherence to planned exercise regimens, making it easier for users to maintain a consistent exercise schedule. Especially when life becomes hectic, having a workout reminder ensures that exercise does not get sidelined. Regular alerts contribute to greater consistency in training, which is pivotal for the long-term development of healthy, consistent exercise routines.

While reminder features are designed to enhance consistent motivation, they come with potential downsides, such as notification fatigue. If notifications become too intrusive, users might start ignoring alerts or even disable them, leading to decreased engagement with the app. Excessive notifications can become a source of annoyance rather than assistance if they are too frequent or not intelligently scheduled to align with the user's lifestyle. This irritation can diminish user engagement and motivation, reducing the likelihood of the app’s continued use.

    
\subsubsection{Social Networking} 
Socialising features in fitness apps enable users to share their workout progress and achievements with others, either within the app's community or on external social media platforms. These features foster a sense of community and collective engagement, allowing users to celebrate milestones publicly. By connecting with friends or joining fitness communities, users can share their daily achievements and compare their progress with that of their peers. The inclusion of social features in fitness apps offers several benefits, transforming exercise from a solitary activity into a shared, communal experience.

Socialising features enable users to connect through shared challenges and goals, leveraging the competitive and cooperative aspects of fitness. By allowing users to share their progress, these features foster a sense of community, providing social reinforcement and accountability, which are crucial motivators for maintaining an active lifestyle. Celebrating milestones publicly can enhance motivation and accountability, tapping into the social aspects of fitness, which can be a powerful motivator. The encouragement and support received from peers within the app can be highly motivating, helping users to remain consistent with their fitness routines.

Despite their benefits, socialising features in fitness apps can also present challenges. Privacy concerns are a significant issue for some users who may prefer to keep their fitness journey private rather than share details publicly, especially if the app shares updates beyond its platform or employs lax privacy controls. Moreover, constant social feeds and notifications can shift the focus from personal fitness goals to social interaction, potentially turning the app into a distraction similar to traditional social media. This can lead to negative comparisons with others, which might demotivate users. Furthermore, an overreliance on external validation for motivation can diminish intrinsic motivation, reducing the personal satisfaction derived from exercising. Additionally, apps with extensive social features can become complex to navigate, featuring numerous menus, settings, and notifications related to social interactions, which can complicate the user experience and detract from the app's core fitness functions.

    
\subsubsection{Gamification} 

Gamification features in fitness apps incorporate elements traditionally found in games, such as badges, achievements, points, levels, and progress bars, to motivate and engage users. By engaging in specific challenges, completing quests, or reaching fitness milestones, users can earn rewards and visually track their advancement, similar to progression systems found in video games. These features reward users for completing specific challenges and quests, allowing them to "level up" or observe their progress through visual progress bars. 

This integration of game-like elements provides tangible rewards for users’ efforts, enhancing their motivation and engagement with the app, thereby making the fitness journey both fun and rewarding. The inclusion of gamification elements in fitness routines can motivate users to persist in their fitness endeavors by rewarding them for meeting specific goals and challenges.

While gamification can offer benefits, it also has potential drawbacks. The focus on earning rewards and leveling up can sometimes overshadow the fundamental aspects of fitness. This shift in focus from health improvement to winning or scoring can undermine the true purpose of fitness activities. Furthermore, the novelty of gamification may diminish over time, which could decrease its motivational effect. Some users might perceive these features as gimmicky or trivial, detracting from the app's perceived value. Additionally, fitness apps with gamification interfaces can be challenging to navigate, potentially alienating users who prefer more straightforward, easy-to-use tools. The need to understand and engage with various gamification elements like point systems and levels requires extra cognitive effort, which could overwhelm some users, making the app seem cumbersome and detracting from its primary function of health monitoring and improvement.

\section{Implementation Strategies for Workout Apps: Technical Development and User-Centric Enhancements}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Initial Release: Emphasising Core Features and Standard Tracking Capabilities}

The development of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for the workout tracking app focused on establishing core functionalities and a robust tracking framework. By selecting Kotlin for its advanced features and Android Studio for its comprehensive development tools, the foundation was set for a scalable and reliable application. This phase was critical in laying the groundwork for subsequent enhancements, ensuring that the MVP not only met basic user needs but also provided a solid base for future development and community collaboration.

\subsubsection{Development Environment and Language Selection}

For the development of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for the workout tracking app, I chose Kotlin as the primary programming language. Kotlin is renowned for its modern features that enhance developer productivity and software robustness, making it particularly suitable for Android app development. Compared to Java, Kotlin provides significant advantages, such as null safety, extension functions, and improved syntax that helps reduce boilerplate code, which are crucial for maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. These features significantly reduce the likelihood of common programming errors, such as null pointer exceptions, and streamline the development process by allowing more functions with fewer lines of code.

Android Studio was selected as the integrated development environment (IDE) for its comprehensive support for Android development. This IDE is directly supported by Google and offers advanced features for code editing, debugging, performance tuning, and version control integration. Android Studio's robust set of tools includes a real-time profiler that helps track memory usage and CPU cycles, an emulator to test applications in various Android configurations, and an integrated testing framework that facilitates continuous integration and deployment processes. These tools are essential for managing a complex development project single-handedly, as they enable efficient debugging and performance optimisation, critical for ensuring a high-quality user experience.

\subsubsection{Planning and Initial Development}
The initial phase of the project involved meticulous planning and setup of the development environment. Establishing a Git repository was a foundational step for effective version control. This repository was not only crucial for tracking changes and managing different development branches but also served as a backup and documentation tool. It allowed me to revert to previous versions of the codebase when needed and facilitated a structured development process where incremental changes were documented and tracked systematically.

The planning of the MVP's features was detailed and methodical. I utilised various project management tools to create a timeline and set milestones for the project, ensuring that each feature was developed on schedule and met predefined specifications. This included the development of user interface elements, backend logic, and integration of third-party services like database management and API interfaces. Each major feature, such as exercise logging and user customisation options, was developed iteratively. These features were tested in isolated environments before being merged into the main project branch, ensuring they functioned as expected without introducing bugs to the working codebase.

\subsubsection{Background Research and Competitive Analysis}
Conducting extensive background research ensured that the app was not only technically sound but also met the practical needs of its users. This involved studying various types of gym equipment and the specific exercises associated with each, which would form a comprehensive database within the app. Additionally, I researched muscle groups and workout routines to offer scientifically-backed exercise recommendations within the app. This level of detail was intended to provide users with not just a tracking tool but also a resource for learning and improving their workout efficiency.

The competitive analysis involved downloading and using numerous existing fitness apps to understand their functionality, user interface, and user experience. I analysed user reviews and ratings for these apps to identify common pain points and features that were well-received. This analysis helped pinpoint essential features and functionalities that were popular among users and those that were lacking in current offerings on the market. By integrating this insight into the development of my app, I aimed to create a product that not only matched but surpassed the user experience provided by existing apps.

\subsubsection{Implementation and Iteration}
Adopting a branch-based workflow in Git for developing and integrating new features allowed for a structured and efficient development process. This approach was instrumental in minimising disruptions to the main codebase, facilitating isolated testing, and refining of each component before integration. It provided a safety net by isolating experimental features from the production environment, ensuring that any new code would not destabilise the core functionalities of the app.

The implementation phase was characterised by a continuous loop of coding, testing, and debugging to refine features and ensure the app's reliability and performance. Each feature underwent rigorous testing in simulated environments using the Android Studio emulator as well as on physical Android devices. This dual approach allowed me to catch and fix device-specific bugs and optimise the app's performance across different hardware configurations. The debugging process was especially focused on optimising memory usage and ensuring smooth UI interactions, which are critical for the fluid performance of mobile applications.

\subsubsection{Preparing for Release}
The preparation for the GitHub release involved thorough documentation and final code refinements. Releasing the MVP on GitHub not only provided a platform for version control and issue tracking but also opened the project to the community for feedback, bug reports, and potential contributions from other developers. This collaborative aspect was intended to foster an open-source community around the app, which could lead to faster iterations and more robust feature development.

In parallel, I prepared for the app store submission, which involved meeting the technical and policy requirements of various app marketplaces. This included fine-tuning the app's metadata, such as descriptions, tags, and visuals, which play a significant role in how the app is perceived by potential users. Ensuring compliance with privacy policies and user interface guidelines was also crucial for a smooth review process by the app stores. This meticulous preparation was aimed at optimising the app's visibility and user acquisition strategy upon launch.

Each of these phases was crucial in developing a comprehensive, user-friendly, and competitive workout tracking app. The detailed planning, robust research, and meticulous implementation and testing phases were designed to ensure that the app not only met but exceeded the expectations of its potential users, setting a strong foundation for future enhancements.

\subsection{Advancing User Engagement: Iterative Design and Enhanced Functionality in Version 2 of TrainingTracker(TT)}

The development of version 2 of the workout tracking app represented a focused endeavor to improve the user interface and integrate functionalities that would set a foundation for future enhancements. By prioritising accessibility and user engagement through sophisticated design choices and forward-thinking feature integration, this phase was instrumental in evolving the app's design and functionality. Although not released to the public, the advancements made in this version were crucial in preparing the app for a more comprehensive and robust version 3, which aimed to combine these improvements with new features for a full public launch.

 \subsubsection{Enhancing User Interface and Accessibility}




After evaluating the initial release of the MVP, I embarked on developing version 2 of the workout tracking app with a focus on significantly enhancing the user interface (UI) and accessibility. This effort was motivated by the need to make the app more visually appealing and functionally accessible to users with diverse needs, including those with color vision deficiencies. Research into visual accessibility suggested that a color palette featuring strong contrasts, such as yellow and blue, would be most beneficial for users with color blindness. Implementing this involved meticulous adjustments to the app’s CSS and XML files to ensure uniform application across the app’s interface, adhering to accessibility standards and improving the user experience.

Simultaneously, the app’s logo was redesigned to better communicate its identity and to align visually with these new accessibility improvements. This new logo was crafted using vector graphics, a method chosen for its scalability and clarity across various device resolutions and screen sizes. The redesign aimed to enhance brand recognition and consistency, which are crucial for user retention and engagement.

 \subsubsection{Integrating Advanced Functionalities}

To further engage users and enrich the app’s functionality, I introduced several new features in version 2. One of the major additions was the progress analysis tool, equipped with graphical displays to visually represent workout trends and achievements. While the backend integration for dynamically syncing user data was still under development, the frontend interface was prepared to handle these features upon completion. This forward-looking design was intended to motivate users by visually documenting their progress, thus encouraging more consistent app usage.

Additionally, the muscle visualisation feature was designed to educate users about the muscles involved in their workouts. Using detailed vector graphics prepared in Inkscape, this feature allowed users to interactively explore different muscle groups, thus enhancing the app's educational value. This functionality aimed not only to inform but also to engage users more deeply with their fitness routines by providing a clear link between exercises and the muscles they target.

\subsubsection{Optimising Data Structures and User Experience}

The integration of new features necessitated a comprehensive overhaul of the app’s data architecture. To accommodate the enhanced functionality and ensure smooth performance, I optimised the existing database schema and introduced new indexing strategies. These improvements were critical for enabling quick data access and efficient management of the increased data volume produced by the new features.

A major goal for version 2 was to streamline user interactions within the app. Efforts to refine the UI supported intuitive touch gestures, such as long presses for editing and deleting entries, which simplified the user experience by reducing the number of steps needed to perform common tasks. These UI enhancements were aimed at minimising user effort, thereby making the app more intuitive and reducing cognitive load.

\subsubsection{Final Preparations for Public Release}

The development of version 2 was completed with extensive testing to ensure that all new features were integrated smoothly and functioned as intended. However, unlike the first iteration, version 2 was not prepared for immediate public release. The focus of this phase was on refining the interface and backend processes, setting the stage for a more comprehensive version 3 that would include these enhancements along with additional functionalities suitable for public deployment.

Testing involved simulated user interactions on multiple device configurations to ensure compatibility and performance. These tests were crucial for identifying any issues in real-time, allowing for timely corrections and ensuring that the app would ultimately meet the high standards of user experience set in the MVP.

\section{Evaluating Workout App Performance: Efficiency and User Satisfaction Metrics}


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Critical Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}

{\bf A topic-specific chapter} 
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
This chapter is intended to evaluate what you did.  The content is highly 
topic-specific, but for many projects will have flavours of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item functional  testing, including analysis and explanation of failure 
      cases,
\item behavioural testing, often including analysis of any results that 
      draw some form of conclusion wrt. the aims and objectives,
      and
\item evaluation of options and decisions within the project, and/or a
      comparison with alternatives.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This chapter often acts to differentiate project quality: even if the work
completed is of a high technical quality, critical yet objective evaluation 
and comparison of the outcomes is crucial.  In essence, the reader wants to
learn something, so the worst examples amount to simple statements of fact 
(e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y''); the best examples are analytical 
and exploratory (e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y, which means Z; this 
contradicts [1], which may be because I use a different assumption'').  As 
such, both positive {\em and} negative outcomes are valid {\em if} presented 
in a suitable manner.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

\noindent
The concluding chapter of a dissertation is often underutilised because it 
is too often left too close to the deadline: it is important to allocate
enough attention to it.  Ideally, the chapter will consist of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (Re)summarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence
      summing up the content.
\item Clearly state the current project status (e.g., ``X is working, Y 
      is not'') and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the 
      initial aims and objectives (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined 
      previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').  There 
      is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is 
      important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.
\item Outline any open problems or future plans.  Rather than treat this
      only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more 
      time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
      (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results, this 
      could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further 
      study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use,
      which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to 
      resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').
\end{enumerate}

% =============================================================================

% Finally, after the main matter, the back matter is specified.  This is
% typically populated with just the bibliography.  LaTeX deals with these
% in one of two ways, namely
%
% - inline, which roughly means the author specifies entries using the 
%   \bibitem macro and typesets them manually, or
% - using BiBTeX, which means entries are contained in a separate file
%   (which is essentially a databased) then inported; this is the 
%   approach used below, with the databased being dissertation.bib.
%
% Either way, the each entry has a key (or identifier) which can be used
% in the main matter to cite it, e.g., \cite{X}, \cite[Chapter 2}{Y}.
%
% We would recommend using BiBTeX, since it guarantees a consistent referencing style 
% and since many sites (such as dblp) provide references in BiBTeX format. 
% However, note that by default, BiBTeX will ignore capital letters in article titles 
% to ensure consistency of style. This can lead to e.g. "NP-completeness" becoming
% "np-completeness". To avoid this, make sure any capital letters you want to preserve
% are enclosed in braces in the .bib, e.g. "{NP}-completeness".

\backmatter

\bibliography{dissertation}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The dissertation concludes with a set of (optional) appendicies; these are 
% the same as chapters in a sense, but once signaled as being appendicies via
% the associated macro, LaTeX manages them appropriatly.

\appendix

\chapter{An Example Appendix}
\label{appx:example}

Content which is not central to, but may enhance the dissertation can be 
included in one or more appendices; examples include, but are not limited
to

\begin{itemize}
\item lengthy mathematical proofs, numerical or graphical results which 
      are summarised in the main body,
\item sample or example calculations, 
      and
\item results of user studies or questionnaires.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that in line with most research conferences, the marking panel is not
obliged to read such appendices. The point of including them is to serve as
an additional reference if and only if the marker needs it in order to check
something in the main text. For example, the marker might check a program listing 
in an appendix if they think the description in the main dissertation is ambiguous.
