Here is the outline of my dissertation. 
I want to write the 3-(1) part, namely MVP implementation - gitHub release.
I will provide you the git logs I had while I was implementing it. 
can you write that section for me?
You can also use subsections, if applicable.

- abstract

- introduction

- background

1. focusing on muscles...
	(1) muscle growth
	(2) muscle loss
	(3) 1RM

2. ...

- project execution

1. Investigate factors that can extend user engagement and commitment to their physical goals and understand the role of the training tracking app in sustaining this motivation.
	why is it important to understand roles of the app?
	(what can it do?)
	start from the role of the training tracking app, why do people use it? what are possible benefits which workingout traking apps can offer? / why do people not use it? what are possible shortcomings of workingout tracking apps -> keep the reasons why people use it and benefits, cover the reasons why do people not use it and shortcommings. 
	1. why is it important to understand the role of the app
	2. what is the role of the workout tracking app / pros
	3. cons


2. Design an application that addresses the possible shortcomings of workout apps, which can deter consistency, and enhance the benefits that such apps can offer to users.
	smart goal planning
	app development planning (rough goal of each version?)
	app design (what features do I need to implement...)


3. Implement the app by utilising technical resources to improve the user experience.
	(1) MVP(minimal viable product) implementation 
		* language and development environment choice/justification (I chose kotlin and android studio - for an android app development)
		* developing the MVP
			- made plan for what will MVP be like(before implementation)
			- to plan what to implement for the MVP in detail
			- made git repository
			- added basic app template
			- checked open-sources libraries I can use
		* background research
			- research on gym equipments, exercises, muscles (will be added on the app)
			- downloaded and checked other similar apps roughly
			- read a book about a routine tracking app(it has recording and tracking features), about how to keep user on apps with phichological factors to consider
			- found some sturdies about muscle recovery
		* app testing		
			- request testing devices
			- computer science techinical advice meeting (7 Feb 2024)
			- got two android phones with different sizes/resolutions/chipsets/andorid versions
			- connected testing devices and downloaded the app on them
			- I was testing the app when I go to the gym
		* focus on key features of the app (can log quantifiable data, can add and delete exercise(customisable), can log exercise, can check the app version on the setting screen)
			- implemented basic features			
			- data is stored locally
			- able to add / delete customised exercises
			- able to log working out process
		* can behave like standard fitness trackers
		* gitHub release
		* preparing app launching
			- checked how to upload application on app stores


	(2) version 2 implementation
		focus on user interface (logo design, ui improvement)
		user friendly ui (picked colour scheme(yellow & blue for colour blind people, intuitive ui for exercise cards and layout, arrangement) )
	(3) version 2.1 implementation - app deployment (app store release, gitHub release)
		focus on researched factors (user centered app)
	(4) version 3 implementation
		integration test implementation
		feedback agaile reflection

4. Evaluate the app in terms of efficiency and user satisfaction and demonstrate that the proposed enhancements are beneficial.
	smart goal evaluation
	app reviews
	what I can do better if I do it again next time?

- conclusion 
	what studies should follow ]
