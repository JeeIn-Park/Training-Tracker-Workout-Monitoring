minor error / inconvenience / suggestions report


% tag selection reset 
-> life cycle control 
home add card activity to add card fragment
addOnDestinationChangedListener added for fragment bottom nav bar error fix
added an extra argument for homeCardAdapter constructor and used function references instead of lambda functions in homeFragment. It calls navigator with wrappers so the abstract adapter got the access to the navigator without being initialised.
log activity to log fragment

tag addition improved layout
