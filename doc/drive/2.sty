### Evaluation of Version 2 Implementation

In the development of the second version of TrainingTracker (TT), the primary aim was to integrate market survey results and practical needs of users into the application. This section critically evaluates the functional and behavioral testing conducted during this phase, as well as the decisions made in comparison to alternative options.

#### Functional Testing

The functional testing of version 2 focused on several new features and enhancements:

1. **Muscle Status Visualization**:
   - **Implementation**: The app now includes a visual representation of muscle status, indicating recovery states using distinct colors.
   - **Testing**: This feature was tested to ensure accurate updates of muscle status based on user activity logs. Edge cases, such as incorrect timestamps or missing data, were also evaluated.
   - **Failure Cases**: Initial tests revealed issues with the visual update mechanism where muscle statuses were not refreshing correctly. This was traced back to a caching problem, which was resolved by ensuring real-time updates upon each app launch  .

2. **Tagging and Filtering Mechanisms**:
   - **Implementation**: Users can create custom tags and filter exercises based on these tags. This feature was aimed at enhancing user customization and exercise management.
   - **Testing**: Functional testing involved creating, deleting, and assigning tags to ensure seamless operation. The filtering mechanism was also tested across different fragments to verify consistency.
   - **Failure Cases**: Some users reported that tags were not persisting across sessions, which was due to improper local storage handling. This was corrected by enhancing the data persistence logic in the app  .

3. **One-Repetition Maximum (1RM) Tracking**:
   - **Implementation**: The app calculates and tracks 1RM values for various exercises, providing insights into user progress.
   - **Testing**: This feature was validated by comparing calculated 1RM values with manually computed ones. The integration of 1RM tracking into the logging and status screens was also tested.
   - **Failure Cases**: A discrepancy was found in the 1RM calculations due to rounding errors, which was subsequently fixed by implementing a more precise mathematical approach【12†source】 .

4. **Floating Action Button and UI Enhancements**:
   - **Implementation**: The floating action button was made draggable, and several UI elements were redesigned for better user interaction.
   - **Testing**: The usability of the draggable button and the new UI layout were tested through user interactions and feedback.
   - **Failure Cases**: Users initially found the draggable button distracting. Its behavior was refined to become semi-transparent when not in use, improving the overall user experience  .

#### Behavioral Testing

Behavioral testing focused on user interactions and the overall usability of the new features:

1. **User Feedback Integration**:
   - **Methodology**: Feedback was collected via Google Forms, email correspondence, and in-person testing sessions. Anonymization processes were strictly followed to maintain user privacy.
   - **Results**: Users appreciated the muscle visualization and tagging features but reported difficulties in navigating the settings and understanding the 1RM tracking initially. This feedback led to additional in-app tutorials and help sections  .

2. **Usability and Engagement**:
   - **Testing**: Usability tests were conducted to observe how intuitively users could interact with the new features. Engagement metrics such as session duration and feature usage frequency were tracked.
   - **Conclusions**: The enhancements led to increased user engagement, with a notable rise in session durations and repeat usage of the muscle status and tagging features. However, there were challenges in ensuring users understood the full potential of the 1RM tracking without guided assistance【12†source】 .

#### Evaluation of Options and Decisions

Throughout the version 2 implementation, several decisions were made regarding feature development and design choices:

1. **Design Choices**:
   - **UI Color Scheme**: The choice of a yellow and blue color palette aimed to accommodate users with red/green color blindness. This decision was based on accessibility principles and was well-received by users  .
   - **Centralized String Formatting**: Implementing the `FormattedStringGetter` class for consistent data presentation was crucial for maintaining a uniform UI and simplifying updates. This choice proved effective in reducing inconsistencies across different app sections .

2. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - **Factory Design Pattern**: Employing the factory design pattern for data object instantiation streamlined the creation process and enhanced the app's scalability. This architectural choice was compared to direct instantiation methods and found to be superior in terms of maintainability and flexibility  .
   - **Exception Handling**: Enhancing data storage methods with detailed exception handling improved data integrity and security, which was a significant upgrade over the previous version's basic error handling approach  .

3. **User-Centered Approach**:
   - **Feedback Integration**: Direct user feedback mechanisms, such as the `Report Error` and `Send Feedback` features, were implemented to foster a community-driven development process. This approach was compared to periodic surveys and found to be more effective in real-time issue resolution and feature enhancement【12†source】 .

Overall, the second version of TrainingTracker successfully integrated user feedback and market survey results to enhance functionality and user engagement. The iterative design process, coupled with rigorous testing and thoughtful decision-making, resulted in a more robust and user-friendly application.
