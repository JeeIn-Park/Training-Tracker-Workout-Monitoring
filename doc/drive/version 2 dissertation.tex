the main aim of this project is increasing accesiblity of the app


(2) version 2 implementation
* made the developer account
* implementing the second version of the app
    - focus on user interface (logo design, ui improvement)
    -user friendly ui (picked colour scheme(yellow & blue for colour blind people, intuitive ui for exercise cards and layout, arrangement) )
    - click card to enter log
    - improved card layout
    - show the past records and the personal best record
    - show analysis of the progress (graph – still need to connect it to user’s data, but frontend implementation is done)
    - muscle visualisation (still need to work on colour change features, but I’ve done visualisation each muscle with vector graphics, used “inkscape”)
    - designed app logo
    - Find some errors and fixed (about data structures and classes)
    - enhancing user experiences
(minimalise steps that user needs to take to log their progress, user can customise set recording, long click to delete a card with warning)


2nd version - Improve usability
% git log categorising
% functionality - why did I implement it / how did I implement it?
% app scalability / technical explanation


\version v2.0.0 {
    focus on enhancing existing functionality
    (prepare for additional functionalities)
}

button, need to change colours
layout rename
miminum api requirement chanaged \todo : need to check why I changed it
serialisable error fi
one rep max algorithm
one rep max, I wanna use different file for different exercise

button theme
bottom nav theme
colour scheme added

% Home framgment
recycler clickable
click home recycler work
home, long clickable
home card layout
home card visibility
added tag bar
scroll bar
card text change
exercise card item layout changed


    % muscle visualisation {

]
wrap content for the height and then put recycler view for the remaining page


% Add card Activity
fix add a new card error
only one line is permitted for the exercise name


% Scalability




(3) version 2.1 implementation - app deployment (app store release, gitHub release)
focus on researched factors (user centered app)


\version v2.1.0 {
    adding new functionalities
} 

% Home framgment

% Status Fragment 

% Setting Fragment 


% Add log Avtivity

% Add card Activity

% Scalability

critical evaluation
user feedback
what can I do better
following studies

4. Evaluate the app in terms of efficiency and user satisfaction and demonstrate that the proposed enhancements are beneficial.
	smart goal evaluation
	app reviews
	what I can do better if I do it again next time?
