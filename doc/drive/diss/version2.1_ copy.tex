significant changes 

1. new features implementation (Tag & Muscle & Workout Analysis)

(1). Tag

first implementation attempt : use string to deal with each tag (there was no specified data structure for tags)
second implementation attempt : implemented tag data class for clearer data strucrue and management 
    adding tag class
    add tag object created
    plus button

\view
tag layout
recycler mapping
horrizontal recycler
tag layout with padding

\viewModel
tag adapter
going to add view holder for the tag
trying to change colour when clicked
implementing tag background colour, changed extracted strings
implementing the colour changing for the tag but doesn
fixed add button doesn't work. it was because lastly it assgien the behaviour of it when it's clicked in the adapter later than the fragement. but the correct behaviour was defined in the fragment
adding tag works again
will manually change the colour rn
selected state is corrrectly being passed
change colour work

\model
tag storage
save tags when it's added
delete and edit tag work

%utilisation
\addCardActivity

    filter works, need to edit status
    reset tags when stop app
    add tag (? what did I exactly mean by this?)

(2). Muscle
new implementation attempt : muscle class added

\view
to image button
resized
just gonna make other drawable buttons
need to change it to lowercase

\viewModel
1. tried to change path data's colour
2. manually add all the states and select by muscle state
do not fill up whole background...
I made muscle view model but I think I will try to use livedata firsty
I am just going to manually change the colour
color changing works, but need to override
only change muscle status when <50/15>
muscle colouring
adjusting code
okay I will hardcode
vectors
muscle colour vectors
work
muscle colour works

\model
muscle status algorithm
update muscle state when log, but exercises are invisible (? what did I exactly mean by this?)
refresh muscle, need to change colour also when the last activity is null
when it's null -> find when the user downloaded the app and if the time and use it as the last activity (add last activity!)
detailed exception control for loadMuscles

select muscle (? what did I exactly mean by this?)
refresh muscle implementation (? what did I exactly mean by this?)
list of ids (? what did I exactly mean by this?)

%utilisation
\addCardActivity
    multiple ite selectiable
    add multiple muscles and tags


(3) workout analysis 
\graph
data point with distances

\predicted 1RM
update existing data structure (added 1RM)
deal with empty list for algorithm
One rep max -> 1rm

data structure update
    \ExerciseCard
        one rep max to exercise card, so don't need to calculate again and again
    \ExerciseLog
        one rep max 
    \ExerciseSet
        one rep max

% Status Fragment 
will change the status layout
implementing the graph
status card
status recycler
table setup object
grapg visibility


% Add log Avtivity
changed the data structure, but the log storage is not initialisable 
\todo : need to check which data structure is actually changed in this state
today's log - match parent
Additionally, the use of an empty row at the end of each session improves visual separation and helps distinguish between sessions.
when add log or card, the most current one to the first index
I will do the add log activity first
add log layout
one rep max with two decimal with kg
one rep max bar
make part bold
new line instead of coloum
implementing the graph
today box : user don't know where to log
table setup object
add log activity keep updating thr logs
grapg visibility
1rm bar visibility
1rm visibility and formatting, muscle text formattin
floating button loaction


(4) add card 
% Add card Activity
remove edit mode
tag dropdown menu
card edit
home add card works
add card layout

% Home framgment
floating button layout 
floating button acts
home add card works
home card adapter updated
home layout
home card one rep max
moving floating button around
button is clickable
don't go too up and down
floating button goes left or right
fading out
floating button up and down
floating button clickable



(5) feedback / error report / privacy policy
% Setting Fragment 
implementing setting screen
setting privacy policy
privacy poilicy up button
privacy policy scroll bar
send feedback via email
reporting
error reporting
feedback and reporting handelr


2. data structure & data management 
% Scalability
change package name
string formatter
formatter -> stringGetter
1rm visibility and formatting, muscle text formattin
going to rename packge
package domain changed
debuggable
turn off debugging
version name update
app version

-- app scalability update
(1). improved data management : factory pattern implementation, set default value 
    ExerciseCard, ExerciseLog, ExerciseSet, Tag, Muscle
    muscle drawable selector to muscle factory, horizontal scrollbar
    tag factory, applying tag storage

(2). secure data treatment : storage -save in private
(3). observer pattern 


3. new declaration on fragments in terms of their roles

(3) storage sequence adoptation 
    ExerciseCard, ExerciseLog






\\\version 1.5 : 
didn't have 1rm for log, card

(3) version 2.1 implementation - app deployment (app store release, gitHub release)
focus on researched factors (user centered app)
enhancing user experiences
(minimalise steps that user needs to take to log their progress, user can customise set recording, long click to delete a card with warning)


and analysis available on the logging screen. 
this is the noticable unique feature of this app. 
other exercise apps are separating the analysis screen and the logging screen, 
also, not only giving the past logs, can see the progress at a glance. 
so it is also better than just using excel which simply gives you past logs.
Making analysis is possible with excel as well, but for this, users need to manually setup all the things for each exercise they add.
but with this app, 



feedback agaile reflection


version 3 dissertation

survey result
user feedbacks -> solution


git log categorising
functionality - why did I implement it / how did I implement it?
app scalability / technical explanation



critical evaluation
user feedback
what can I do better
following studies

4. Evaluate the app in terms of efficiency and user satisfaction and demonstrate that the proposed enhancements are beneficial.
