when add exercise 
-> add a new file for log (for each exercise)
when delete exercise 
-> delete the file

change the log storage algorithm
add exercise to make a file
no need to filter logs with id
delete exercise to delete a file (in both recycler views)
passing what exercise I am doing when log -> find file name -> pass the file name
	basically, the file name needs to be able to be changed dynimically

exercise_cards.dat

* ExerciseCard
    val id : UUID = UUID.randomUUID(),
    val lastActivity: LocalDateTime?,
    val timeAdded : LocalDateTime,
    val name : String,
    val mainMuscles : List<String>,
    val subMuscles : List<String>?,
    val tag : List<String>?

--------------------------------------------
log_id.dat

* ExerciseLog
    val dateTime: LocalDateTime,
    val exerciseCard: UUID,
    val exerciseSetList: List<ExerciseSet>,
    val totalSet: Int?,
    val totalWeight: Float?
---------------------------------------------

data class ExerciseSet(
    val dateTime: LocalDateTime,
    val exerciseCard: UUID,
    val mass: Float?,
    val set: Int?,
    val rep: Int?
) : Serializable




what's the best way to reverse the log data?

add one rep max for each card, so don't need to calculate again and again
