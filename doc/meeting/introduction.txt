In recent years there has been a surge in public awareness of the important role physical activity plays in maintaining health, which is reflected in the frequency of gym visits. From 2010 to 2019, there had been a 24% increase in the number of individuals attending the gym over 100 times annually. (https://runrepeat.com/gym-membership-statistics) 

As fitness demands increase, the importance of monitoring workout progress becomes more apparent because the availability of quantifiable data can stimulate users' interest in enhancing their activity levels. This implies that providing tools to track this data supports the maintenance of motivation and commitment to fitness goals, which could lead to improved health outcomes over time.

The growth in recognition of training and tracking progression has led to significant expansion in the global fitness app market, as these apps allow users to monitor their workouts anytime and anywhere. In 2023, the market was valued at $1.54 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% from 2024 to 2030. (https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/fitness-app-market) This trend is underscored by a marked rise in the number of fitness app users and downloads, with hundreds of millions of users and over 850 million downloads reported in 2023 alone.

The market expansion has led to numerous workout tracking apps that primarily focus on quantitative data. However, features limited to logging and analysing progress are inadequate for sustaining user adherence to physical activity goals. Identifying and integrating motivational factors into app design is crucial for enhancing user engagement and promoting consistent exercise routines.

The primary goal of this project is to create an Android application designed to effectively monitor workout routines and boost motivation.
More particularly, the solid aims are: 

1. Investigate factors that can extend user engagement and commitment to their physical goals and understand the role of the training tracking app in sustaining this motivation.
2. Design an application that addresses the possible shortcomings of workout apps, which can deter consistency, and enhance the benefits that such apps can offer to users.
3. Implement the app by utilising technical resources to improve the user experience.
4. Evaluate the app in terms of efficiency and user satisfaction and demonstrate that the proposed enhancements are beneficial.
